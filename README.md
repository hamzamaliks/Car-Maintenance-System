Project Title: ‘Car Maintenance Database System’


Abstract:



Today we are living in an advance era surrounded with technology. So, every system needs a database in which we can store its data and we can retrieve it easily. So, we came up with a idea to create a database system for our car maintenance workshop so that the data of the customers, cars and bill can be maintained.
Thus, we applied the knowledge of Database System that we gained in the class and using our previous experience with sql we developed a Database System that cover up such a problem in a Car Maintenance System.
